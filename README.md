Give me your favorite city, I'll give you Facebook pages around you.

What I used:
 * [Pyramid](http://www.pylonsproject.org/) for back-end
 * [Deform](http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/deform/en/latest/) for forms and [Colander schemas](http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/colander/en/latest/) for their validation
 * [Leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com/) to plot points on maps
 * [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) for map engine
 * [GoogleMaps Python client](https://github.com/googlemaps/google-maps-services-python) for getting GPS coordinates
 * [Facebook Python SDK](https://github.com/mobolic/facebook-sdk) for the obvious stuff

This app was built to work with Python 2.7.

### Now, to get this thing to work:

Do the following.

1. Create a config.py file for reading your API keys. The common practice is to embed them as environment variables in your local system. Maybe something like: 
```python
GOOGLEMAPS_API_KEY = os.environ['GOOGLEMAPS_API_KEY']
googlemaps_api = {
    'api_key' : GOOGLEMAPS_API_KEY
}
```
2. Create a virtual env and
```sh
$ path/to/env/bin/pip install -e .
```
which will install Pyramid and all our other dependencies from setup.py.
3. After the egg is created, you should be able to 
```sh
$ path/to/env/bin/pserve development.ini --reload
```

Try typing in "Paris" or "Nice, France" or an exact address. Then select a distance and see what you get.
